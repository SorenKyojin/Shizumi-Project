# Shizumi Project
Shizumi (Code name: Shizumi Project) is a "web game" who let players collecting characters from animes, mangas, games etc like Mudae does in Discord.
The big difference is everyone can own the same character without limit like Mudae authorize only one owner.

The objective of the player will be to collect the most characters or collect their favorites.

- Hotel: This is where you'll find your collection of characters and which character you wished.
- Museum (Not upgradable): There is a very low chance that certain characters gives a trophy related to the serie there were from. The museum show your trophies.

Not buildings, but categories:
- Inventory: Shows you the items you own and can use.
- Like or pass (Planned in the developpment): Like Tinder, a character card will appear with a photo and its name. You'll have to choice to like it, or skipping to next character. This system will be built for character popularity.
- This system act like $like command in mudae, but more, more fun and with more randomness.

Garden:
- Sunflower (Common): Each time you claim a character, you get 10 okanes. *+5 per level, Max level: 8*
- Golden Lys (Epic): Each time you get a character, you get 25% of its value. *+25 per level, Max level: 4*
- Lavender (Epic): Increase chances to a 4 star character to appears in the lottery.

## Planned features

- More difficult garden (A nerf, yes): You'll need to hydrate your plants. Not too much, and enough to keep them alive. If a plant die, it will leave the slot, and gives you 2 fertilizers.
  (3 for uncommon, 4 for Epic and 5 for legendary.)
- Like or pass: Random character card will appear. Give it a like to support it to increasing rank or pass to next character. More the character have likes among the serie, rarer it will be.
- Friend system: Add friends by searching with their username#UUID. We use the same method than Riot Game or Discord (before removing it) to indentify users.
- Share system: Show your harem to your friends with a link. They could see all the characters you have, but they couldn't do anything like removing characters.
